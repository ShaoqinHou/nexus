# safe-commit.sh — PreToolUse guard against worktree-isolation leaks.
#
# Hex-empires Phase 6c exposed a worktree leak: a subagent was assigned to a
# worktree but committed directly to main. The worktree existed; the agent
# either resolved .git through the shared dir, never changed CWD into the
# worktree, or committed after stepping out of it. The code landed fine;
# the isolation guarantee broke.
#
# This hook is an opt-in machine guard. When a worktree is spawned for
# agent work, the orchestrator writes a sentinel file at the worktree
# root (`.claude/worktree-sentinel`) whose contents are the worktree's
# expected absolute path. Any `git commit` the agent attempts is then
# checked: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` MUST match the sentinel's
# recorded path, or the commit is blocked.
#
# Opt-in by design: outside of worktree-isolated batches, there is no
# sentinel and the hook is a no-op. Main-branch work from the user's
# primary clone is unaffected.
#
# Wired via `settings.json`:
#   "PreToolUse": [{ "matcher": "Bash",
#                    "hooks": [{ "command": "bash .claude/hooks/safe-commit.sh" }] }]
#
# Fail-loud. If the guard catches a mismatch, the hook exits non-zero
# with a message explaining what went wrong, which blocks the Bash tool
# from executing. The agent then sees the error and has to investigate.

You are trying to land a commit in a different repo/worktree than the
one assigned to this session. This usually means:
  1. You stepped out of your worktree (e.g. \`cd ..\`) before committing.
  2. The git toplevel resolves through a shared .git directory pointing
     at the main repo instead of your worktree.
  3. Your shell was spawned outside the worktree and inherits its CWD.

Fix: cd into the worktree path above and re-run the commit, or spawn
a fresh shell inside the worktree. If this block is itself a bug in the
guard, remove the sentinel file (\`rm $SENTINEL_FILE\`) and reinvoke.
